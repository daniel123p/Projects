PMFG, stands for, "Play My Favorite Games". They are simple scripts that ive written that load video games and their file paths, then run them by wither typing the name in or plugging in a number. Ive worked on making a more robust GUI version of this called, "GameRunner". Im also working on Java programs that will work in conjunction to update the file information whenever i want to add another game to the script. The files are in the Java Project folder. The current one you can download and run for any program is called "ProgramRunner" and its in the associated folder. The GUI is written in python, so are all of the scripts, minus the one in powershell. The main difference between the PMFG versions is weather they use a number or a name to run the games, and the file type they use to store information (CSV, TXT, ect)
