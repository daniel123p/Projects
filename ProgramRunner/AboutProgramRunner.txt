ProgramRunner will run a program, by adding it to a map within a created json file. The key will be the program name, and the filepath to the .exe file of a selected program is the value. It is GUI application that has been made machine independent. Once all programs have been added, buttons will appear that will run a program once clicked. Inside the folder AddPrograms, is an associated java file that will update the JSON file for us. It has 3 jar files that are necessary dependencies. In the output folder is the ProgramRunner v2 zip fie that contains the exe version that has everything already configured. Run it on your computer and give it a try!.
